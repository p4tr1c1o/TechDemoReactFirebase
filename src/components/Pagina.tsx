                    <p>
                        An American spy is in Soviet Russia, digging up information on a powerful Russian politician. He finds him in a bar, walks in dressed in Russian attire, pretending to be Russian. Everybody in the bar looks at him, but he keeps his cool. He orders a drink and walks to the politician...
                        Long
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        &quot;Greetings, comrade.&quot; says the spy, but before he could finish his sentence, the Russian says, &quot;I think you are American spy.&quot;
                        <br />
                        <br />

                        The spy is alarmed, but being a skilled, trained, spy, he says, &quot;That is not true! I am the proudest Soviet there is! I can sing the anthem more beautifully than any other man in the country!&quot;
                        <br />
                        <br />

                        He then proceeds to sing the Soviet anthem, so melodically and beautifully, that everybody in the bar cheers.
                        <br />
                        <br />

                        &quot;Very good, very good!&quot; says the politician. &quot;But I still think you are spy.&quot;
                        <br />
                        <br />

                        The man continues to keep his cool.
                        <br />
                        <br />

                        &quot;I am a historian! I can tell you everything about this glorious country!&quot;
                        <br />
                        <br />

                        He then spends about two hours recounting the Revolution, the Great Patriotic War, about how superior to the Russia is in terms of technology compared to America and makes a great argument about how communism is beneficial to society.
                        <br />
                        <br />

                        &quot;Amazing! You are skilled!&quot; says the politician.
                        <br />
                        <br />

                        The spy smirks.
                        <br />
                        <br />

                        &quot;But I still think you American spy.&quot;
                        <br />
                        <br />

                        The spy is getting frustrated, but still unfazed.
                        <br />
                        <br />

                        He replies, &quot;I am good drinker, a true Russian! Let us drink, and see who can come out top!&quot;
                        <br />
                        <br />

                        The bar turns its attention to the politician and the spy, who are now in a drinking contest.
                        <br />
                        <br />

                        The bartender serves drink after drink of vodka.
                        <br />
                        <br />

                        After about an hour of drinking, the politician nearly passes out, unable to hold as much liquor as the spy, to a resounding cheer amongst the bar.
                        <br />
                        <br />

                        In the midst of the cheering, the Russian politician gets up, smiling, and in a slurred speech, repeats, &quot;You are good, you are good... but I still think you are spy.&quot;
                        <br />
                        <br />

                        The American spy, piss drunk, loses his skill and gives up.
                        <br />
                        <br />

                        &quot;Okay, you got me. I am an American. But what made you think that way, after all this time?&quot;
                        <br />
                        <br />

                        The Russian politician replies, &quot;There arent many black people in Russia.&quot;
